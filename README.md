# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
In this project i have made Real Time Mask Detection project from scratch dataset of images using OpenCV Haarcascade(preprocessing) and i build the Deep learning model to train the dataset using Convolution Neural Network and i get Accuracy above 90%.This project can detect mask in live videos and in images also.
